1. Functions

I just could my head around the functions. How do they work what is their purpose. This led me to so big frustration that in my mind I started to have thoughts that I will never learn to code maybe coding isn't for me.

2. The more advanced topics. After going trough the basic coding tutorials which make you feel that I almost understood something I tried to watch DOM manipulation in Javascript it made me cringe so hard because I did not understood nothing. But I just should have tried to watch every day those more deeper coding topics because there is where the real learning happens. Yes I liked to watch a coding video where you assign a value to the variable, because I felt like I understood that but that is not where the real learning happens. The real learning when you try to always learn the harder topics. And even the variable assigning is still being semented by doing coding challenges. So the basic things I really am learning by doing coding challenges. Variables loops etc. And the harder topics by watching videos.
3. Then I tried to learn React JS because that is the hottest thing in the job market right now. (I should have tried to learn DOM first because if you don't understand how DOM works you won't understand React JS.) It went so hard over my head that I quit. I thought that coding is not for me.
