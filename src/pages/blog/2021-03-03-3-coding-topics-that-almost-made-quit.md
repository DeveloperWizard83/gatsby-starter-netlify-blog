1. Functions

I just could my head around the functions. How do they work what is their purpose. This led me to so big frustration that in my mind I started to have thoughts that I will never learn to code maybe coding isn't for me.

2. The more advanced topics. After going trough the basic coding tutorials which make you feel that I almost understood something I tried to watch DOM manipulation in Javascript it made me cringe so hard because I did not understood nothing. Then I tried to learn React JS because that is the hottest thing in the job market right now. (I should have tried to learn DOM first because if you don't understand how DOM works you won't understand React JS.) It went so hard over my head that I quit. I thought that coding is not for me.
