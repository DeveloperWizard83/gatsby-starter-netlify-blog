description: "My learning to code journey is nearing it's 4th birthday! And by
  far the biggest advacment in my coding abilities came in about a month when I
  made a habbit to make atleast one coding challenge in a day in edabit. Now you
  are saying that you just promote Edabit only because you are affiliate for
  them, but that is not true. I would rather use some free resourse but every
  one of them have had the same problem. They are too hard! In Edabit I have
  mainly done only very easy challenges. I have also done some easy and medium
  challenges. Sometimes I come up with a solution pretty quickly but sometimes
  it takes time. "

At the beginning of the month I had started to make challenges whenever I got too difficult challenge I got frustrated pretty fast. Some wise man has said that you should only try half an hour to solve the problem. Now sometimes it takes me a lot longer to solve the problem but no longer get frustrated instead I have started to enjoy for trying to find resourses to solve the problem to reading the documentation trying different paths to solve the problem and this had came only in two months!
