title: I like to Fry my Brain everyday

description: The reason that I like coding is that it fries my brain. I have
  learned to like that feeling. It is same kind of addiction as you get from
  exercising in a gym and muscles explode.

Altough in the beginning it is easy to fry the brain too much and that caused me brain burnout. Somehow in the beginning the brain is not so prepare for the mental toll the coding causes. I think that is why matematicians get faster better in coding because there brain has gotten used to the mental pain. 

But I think that you can train more of your brains than your muscles. I usual feel mild physical pain in my brain when I have studied intensily, but when I take an hour for example a meditation brake I feel that my brain has recovered. When I train my muscles it usually takes at least two days until I can train again.

What I have learned is that if I have had a big mental burnout from coding and have been forced to have couple of months off. When I get back to coding I have felt that I have missed the time I was in burnout. So it is better to not take the learning too far but be consistant little bit every day. It is like the story about the race between rabbit and the turtle. The turtle won eventually because the rabbit always burned himself out and had to take long brakes. If I would have been the turtle all the time I would have developed as a coder much faster. 

Now I feel I am the turtle. I do atleast one coding challenge in a day. Usually a lot more. I study subjects that expand my knowledge every day and when I feel that my brain has had enough I quit for the day. Going with the flow. Not forcing my self.
