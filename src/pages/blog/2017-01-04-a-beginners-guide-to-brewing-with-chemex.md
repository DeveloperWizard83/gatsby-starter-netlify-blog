description: The reason that I like coding is that it fries my brain. I have
  learned to like that feeling. It is same kind of addiction as you get from
  exercising in a gym and muscles explode.

Altough in the beginning it is easy to fry the brain too much and that caused me brain burnout. Somehow in the beginning the brain is not so prepare for the mental toll the coding causes. I think that is why matematicians get faster better in coding because there brain has gotten used to the mental pain. 

But I think that you can train more of your brains than your muscles. I usual feel mild physical pain in my brain when I have studied intensily, but when I take an hour for example a meditation brake I feel that my brain has recovered. When I train my muscles it usually takes at least two days until I can train again.
