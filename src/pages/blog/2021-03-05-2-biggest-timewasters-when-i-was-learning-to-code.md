1. In the beginning it was difficult to me to understand code that I thought that I must be missing something in my education. Then I run into some youtube that you have to be good at math to be a coder. So I started to learn math and I got to the I went to Calculus 2 halfway. Learning from Khan Academy and I felt that now I was pretty good at math. But then I went back to coding and it did not feel any easier.

I was pissed. I had lost many months learning something that was not very useful in coding. 

2. Second was I will learn machine learning. In this case also it took time from learning to code, because again I was using a lot of time understaning math. Especially calculus 3 and linear algebra which are important in Machine Learning. But should have just focused to code. First learn to code then go what ever direction you want.
