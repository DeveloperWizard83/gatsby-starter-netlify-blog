  You have to learn what the code means that's why coding tutorials are useful.
  Suddenly you realize what the code means and does. When I started to code I
  watched the 30 days of code youtube series. It basically went over my head on
  day 2. It introduced object-oriented programming which is very abstract. I
  felt my brains mashed to a brick wall. How can I ever learn to code if the
  basics are so hard? Now I understand how OOP works a lot better. It takes time
  and repetition but watching videos helps.


  So number 1 is watching coding videos from 10min to 1 hour.

So number 1 is watching coding videos from 10min to 1 hour per day. Watching videos helps you to get familiar with the syntax of coding. At the beginning the syntax looks terrifiying,but when you look at it long enough. It starts to make sense.



Number 2 is Coding challenges I like to use Edabit the challenges are not too difficult and the platform is really easy to use. This is the best place to build your logical thinking in coding.
