description: Someone has said that coding but learning to code is hard. I think
  it is the same in all learning. Learning to drive a car is hard at the
  start(especially if you use a car with a manual gearbox) but when you learn it
  driving becomes so easy can multitask in the car while although you shouldn't.
  I have listed 5 reasons why learning to code is hard.

1 . I wish someone had told me this when I started to learn to code, but here it comes. Think of learning to code as learning a new language all is jibberish at the beginning. But what language learning does not need is logic and for that you need to do coding challenges so your logical muscle gets stronger.

2. It is so abstract! In the code everything is happening in the computer. In the end it is just ones and zeros, but then there is a lot of abstraction so that more abstraction there is the more code comes more implicit instead of descriptive. But it took so much time so my head got around it and still I can get my head hurt if I would watch now for example a functional programming. The syntax is so bizarre.
