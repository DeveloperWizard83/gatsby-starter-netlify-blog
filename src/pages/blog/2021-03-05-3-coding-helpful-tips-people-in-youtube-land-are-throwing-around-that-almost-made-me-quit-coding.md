  1. Make projects


  2. Focus only on one coding language 

  I wanted to try other coding languages and I also tried but I always felt bad because the advice was always that you should focus only one coding language. But I would argue that because learning to code is so hard you should keep it interesting and exciting always. Go with the learning flow. Then at some I realized that all coding languages are practicly the same only syntax is different and then I stuck with the JavaScript and started to went deep with it. At some point you need to go deep with the coding language and then it gets very complex but I all the time understand it more and more.


  3. Math is important in coding. This really did not made me quit but I wasted time in maths.
